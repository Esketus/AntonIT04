<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">Fabio Wibmer joins the Canyon family! </p>
<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">Next to the Sender and the Torque we equipped the Austrian prodigy with a new trials bike, exclusively designed for him. &ldquo;I am very happy to have found a new partner in Canyon, which supplies me not only with an enduro and a downhill bike, but also with a trials bike, and the quality of the Canyon bikes is self-explanatory,&rdquo; adds the young bike all-rounder.</p>
<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">At only 24 years of age, his big lines and his amazing tricks, have already made Fabio Wibmer a big name in the bike scene due to his fearless appearance. This past year alone, he stopped the bike world in their tracks with two breathtaking video projects: &ldquo;Wibmer&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; and the third installment of the &ldquo;Urban Freeride Lives&rdquo; series pushed the visits of his YouTube-channel to incredible heights.</p>
<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;I am extremely pleased to welcome Fabio to Canyon&rdquo;, says Roman Arnold, founder and CEO of Canyon Bicycles. &ldquo;He is an extraordinary character, with a calm demeanor that belies an incredible work ethic coupled with maximum fun on the bike. It is exactly this spirit that engages such a huge audience, that includes me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">Fabio will not only be riding Canyon bikes, his word and opinion will carry weight within our R&amp;D department and also be of importance for future projects: &ldquo;I am looking forward to our close cooperation in the development of new products such as a trial bike designed especially for Fabio, but also to developing the bikes throughout our Gravity world,&rdquo; continues Roman.</p>
<p class="paragraph contentArticleText__text" style="text-align: center;">We are excited to welcome Fabio to the Canyon family!</p>
